. I took the `Either` example and just search/replace, `a` and `b` flipped, therefore `Left` and `Right` flipped too. Had to hide `Left` and `Right` not to collide with those from `Prelude`.

. pretty cool, I had to fix the `Arbitrary` instance for `List`. I had it broken before.

. `let j :: Monad m => m (m a) -> m a; j = join`
. `let l1 :: Monad m => (a -> b) -> m a -> m b; l1 = liftM`
. `let l2 :: Monad m => (a -> b -> c) -> m a -> m b -> m c; l2 = liftM2`
. `let a :: Monad m => m a -> m (a -> b) -> m b; a = flip ap`
. Kinda clunky and there is already `forM` that does that. Anyway, I cracked it. Good feeling.

. Still not totally clear about `join`, need to play with it more. And again `sequence` does just the same.

. I can just with `Applicative` and it works too. I did not use any monadic function here.
