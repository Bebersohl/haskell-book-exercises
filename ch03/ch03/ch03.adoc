== 3 Strings: Simple Operations with Text
=== 3.4 Top-Level versus local definitions
==== Exercises: Scope

. No, `h` is never defined
. No, the value of argument `d` is local to `area` and thus inaccessibe in `r = d / 2`

. Does not compile due to incorrect symbol surrounding strings. Fix: `"<3" ++ " Haskell"`
. Compiles. Result: "<3 Haskell"
